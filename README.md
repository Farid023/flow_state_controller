## Installation üìå 

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flow_state_controller: <latest_version>
```
Then, run:
```terminal
flutter pub get
```

## Quick Start üöÄ
#### 1. Create Controller

The `FlowStateController` is designed to be mixed into your controller class. This allows your controller to manage asynchronous state (loading, success, and failure) seamlessly.

To get started, create a class that uses the `FlowStateController` mixin.

```dart
class DataController with FlowStateController {
  Future<void> fetchData() async {
    await execute<String>(
      key: 'data_fetch',
      executeData: () => api.getData(),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example:
- The `DataController` class is responsible for managing the state of data fetching.
- The `fetchData()` method calls the `execute()` method, which updates the state to `Loading` while fetching the data and then updates it to either `Success` or `Failure` based on the outcome.


#### 2. Observe State
You can observe the state of the operation by subscribing to the stream with `getStream()`. This will allow you to update the UI based on the current state of the asynchronous operation.
```dart
StreamBuilder<FlowStates<String>>(
  stream: controller.getStream(key: 'data_fetch'),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    return snapshot.data?.when(
      loading: () => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      success: (data) => Text('Data: $data'),
      failure: (error) => Text('Error: $error'),
      orElse: () => const Text('Tap to load'),
    ) ?? const Placeholder();
  },
)
```
In this example:
- The `controller.getStream(key: 'data_fetch')` listens to the stream associated with the key `'data_fetch'`.
- Based on the state (loading, success, failure), the appropriate widget is shown in the UI.

#### 3. Access Current State
If you need to check the current state of the operation without listening to a stream, you can directly access the state using the `currentState` method.
```dart
final currentState = controller.currentState<String>('data_fetch');
currentState.when(
  loading: () => print('Loading...'),
  success: (data) => print('Data: $data'),
  failure: (error) => print('Error: $error'),
  orElse: () => print('Unknown state'),
);
```
Here:
- `controller.currentState<String>('data_fetch')` gives you the current state of the `data_fetch` operation, which you can use to make decisions or updates outside the UI thread.

#### 4. Managing Resources with `disposeFlowStateController`
Once you're done using the `FlowStateController`, make sure to call `disposeFlowStateController()` to release resources and prevent memory leaks.
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  controller.disposeFlowStateController();
  super.dispose();
}
```
This ensures that all streams are closed, and memory resources are freed when the controller is no longer needed.

## Key Methods
- `getStream<T>`: Returns a stream for the specified key, allowing you to observe the state of asynchronous operations. This is useful for updating the UI when the state changes.

- `currentState<T>`: Retrieves the current state of the asynchronous operation for a given key. This is useful for checking the state immediately without subscribing to the stream.

- `execute<T>`: Executes an asynchronous task, transitions the state between `Loading`, `Success`, and `Failure`, and invokes any provided callbacks (`onSuccess`, `onError`, `onComplete`).

- `disposeFlowStateController`: Disposes of all streams to prevent memory leaks. Call this method when the controller is no longer in use.
